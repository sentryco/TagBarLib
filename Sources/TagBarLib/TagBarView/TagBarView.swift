import SwiftUI
/**
 * Customized "Scrollable HStack" with animated highlight
 * - Abstract: `TagBar` represents the way to navigate different categories
 * - Description: `TagBar` is an isolated component that communicates with other components through callbacks. The caller of this class is responsible for setting the selected item and scrolling to visible, among other things.
 * - Remark: Is essentially a Horizontal list of buttons
 * - Remark: Has selection state that animates on the x-axis
 * - Remark: `TagBar` is a isolated component that communicate with other components through callbacks
 * - Remark: The caller of this class is responsible for setting the selected item and scrolling to visible etc
 * - Remark: SwiftUI `List` doesn't support rendering and scrolling in a horizontal axis, but you achieve that with ScrollView and LazyHStack.
 * - Note: This is its own repo so we can have less code in app target, own docs, tests etc, and own preview, microservice style!!!
 * - Note: We could use empty trash edition of the trash icon when trash is empty but it doesnt make complete sense from an UX POV, anyways here is the icon we could use: https://feathericons.com/?query=trash
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Mark all tagbar code iOS only? üëà (Do this when cleaning up)
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Maybe make methods that scrolls to start and end? see legacy for code, add this if use case for emerges etc
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Consider opensourcing this repo üëà
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Use uuid as selected index? or overkill?
